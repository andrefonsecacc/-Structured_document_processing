				<fala Personagem="Narrador">It is told among the wise that the First War
					began
					before Arda was full-shaped, and ere yet there was any
					thing
					that grew or walked upon earth; and for long Melkor
					had the upper
					hand. But in the midst of the war a spirit of
					great strength and
					hardihood came to the aid of the Valar,
					hearing in the far heaven
					that there was battle in the Little Kingdom; and
					Arda was filled
					with the sound of his
					laughter. So came Tulkas the Strong, whose
					anger passes
					like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and darkness
					before it;
					and Melkor fled before his wrath and his laughter, and
					forsook Arda, and there was peace for a long age. And
					Tulkas
					remained and became one of the Valar of the Kingdom of Arda; but
					Melkor brooded in the outer
					darkness, and his hate was given to
					Tulkas for ever after.
				</fala>
				<fala Personagem="Melkor">Thus ended the Spring of Arda. The dwelling of
					the Valar uponAlmaren was utterly destroyed!!!

					t in the north
					Melkor
					built his strength, and he
					slept
					not, but watched, and laboured; and the evil things that he
					had perverted walked abroad, and the dark and slumbering woods were
					haunted by monsters and shapes of dread. And in Utumno he gathered
					his demons about him, those
					spirits who first adhered to him in the
					days of his splendour,
					and became most like him in his corruption
