# -Structured_document_processing
 Practical work for structured document processing
 
 - Pratical work nº1-
The document type for the script must be defined in both DTD and XSD, making in each case the best possible use of the expressive ability of the respective language.
A document with a hyphen consists of a header and a hierarchy scenes. The hierarchy of scenes can be arranged in seasons, episodes, and parts.

- Pratical work nº2 - The purpose of this work is to transform the script-type documents previously defined with DTD and XSD. If necessary, changes can be made to these definitions in order to correct deficiencies or to facilitate the transformation process. This transformation has the dual objective of providing a visualization of the scripts and complementing the validation of the scripts
